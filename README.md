# Check My Variable

A combination of Python and shell scripts to verify if your variables are functioning correctly within your program. This project includes scripts for Linux, macOS, and Windows platforms.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3 must be installed on your system.
- Ensure that the `declare-variable.py` script is in the same directory as the script you are running.

## Usage Instructions

The project provides scripts for Linux, macOS, and Windows to execute the `declare-variable.py` script and check its functionality. Follow the instructions below based on your operating system:

### For Linux and macOS

1. **Open a Terminal:**
   - Access the terminal application on your system.

2. **Navigate to the Script Directory:**
   - Use the `cd` command to change to the directory containing the scripts and the `declare-variable.py` file.
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/check-my-variable

3.
Run the Script:
For Linux, execute:
./test-variable-linux.sh
For macOS, execute:
./test-variable-mac.sh
4.
Verify Execution:
The script will check for the existence of declare-variable.py, execute it, and print a success message if it runs without errors. If any issues occur, an error message will be displayed.


For Windows
1.
Open PowerShell:
Access PowerShell from the Start menu or by searching for "PowerShell."
2.
Navigate to the Script Directory:
Use the cd command to change to the directory containing the scripts and the declare-variable.py file.
cd C:\path\to\check-my-variable
3.
Run the Script:
Execute the PowerShell script:
.\test-variable.ps1
4.
Verify Execution:
The script will check for the existence of declare-variable.py, execute it, and print a success message if it runs without errors. If any issues occur, an error message will be displayed.


Additional Information
Ensure that Python is accessible via the python3 command on Linux and macOS, and python on Windows.
The scripts are designed to provide clear feedback on the execution status of the declare-variable.py script, helping you identify any issues with variable functionality.
